Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening a **Wine Bar** in **Athens**, Greece.\n\nSince there are lots of bars in Athens we will try to detect **locations that are not already crowded with bars**. We are also particularly interested in **areas with no Wine Bars in vicinity**. We would also prefer locations **as close to city center as possible**, assuming that first two conditions are met.\n\nWe will use our data science powers to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders."
